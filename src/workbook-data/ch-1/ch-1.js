# Conjugation of regular verbs

## The basics of verbs

As you begin your study of verb tenses in Spanish, it is important to understand
the basic terminology relating to verbs and their formation.

**Conjugation** - The word *conjugation* has two related meanings in Spanish grammar: (1) one of the three groups of verbs classified by the infinitive ending (**-ar**, **-er**, and **-ir** verbs); (2) the set of verb forms consisting of the verb base plus verb endings that correspond to the subject pronouns.

**Infinitive** - The verb in its pure form—the idea of the verb, without any expression of action. In English, all infinitives include the word “to”: “to sing,” “to eat,” “to
live.” In Spanish, all infinitives belong to one of three conjugations, which is determined by the infinitive ending: **-ar**, **-er**, or **-ir**. The infinitive is like a hand grenade before you pull the pin—no real action, but a lot of potential.

**Infinitive Ending** -  The **-ar**, **-er**, or **-ir** ending that identifies the verb conjugation to which the verb belongs, for example, **-ar: cantar** (“to sing”), **-er: comer** (“to eat”), **-ir: vivir** (“to live”).
